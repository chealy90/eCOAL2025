## The Pit - Where the Music Hits the Hardest
Our goal for this project was to design a site for users to share blog posts and reviews on live music events they had been to.
Over the course of a week we worked on:
* A mobile first React application
* Connected it to a MySQL database
* Controlled through a RESTful Laravel API.
